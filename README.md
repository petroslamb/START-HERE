A list of my repos, for orientation.

1. A [presentation](https://github.com/petroslamb/NLP-CyberSecurity-Analytics) at [ICLR2020](https://iclr.cc/virtual/index.html) of a lightning talk for the CyberSecurity social event, on [NLP+CyberSecurity](https://github.com/petroslamb/NLP-CyberSecurity-Analytics).

2. Some [NLP notebooks](https://github.com/petroslamb/nlp-notebooks) and other problems I liked, especially on [Alzheimer's text classification](https://github.com/petroslamb/nlp-notebooks).

3. Towards a production grade [Flask server to serve TensorFlow models](https://github.com/petroslamb/flask-ml-server), written in 5 days flat, which means it needs some more work. :)

4. A [showcase Data Science project](https://github.com/petroslamb/taxi-rides), predicting taxi ride demand for the city of Lima.

5. [My Thesis with code](https://github.com/petroslamb/Relational-Phoenix), for my MSc. in CS, on multicore MapReduce relational operators, for the University of Edinburgh.
